EXILE â€“ An EliXir Irc LoggEr
============================

![Sad Dante is Sad](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Dante_exile.jpg)

I am writing this because I'm too damned lazy to log into IRC, have an open window, and check on conversations I have missed. I am blissfully unaware about the existence of [irclogger.com](http://irclogger.com/). 

Also, I copied the same style because I love the retro feel of it.

## Running

```
% mix deps.get
% mix phoenix.start
```

... and fire up `http://localhost:4000`.

## Adding Channels

Go to `config/config.exs` and add channels to your hearts content.

## How it Looks Like
